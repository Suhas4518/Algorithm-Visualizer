# Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a web-based tool for visualizing various sorting and searching algorithms. It provides a user-friendly interface to help understand how these algorithms work step-by-step.

## Features

The Algorithm Visualizer showcases the following algorithms:

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Insertion Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Merge Sort:** An efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works on the principle of "divide and conquer".
- **Quick Sort:** An efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order.
- **Selection Sort:** An in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists.

### Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search:** A method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
- **Binary Search:** An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository or download the source code.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  From the home page, you can navigate to the "Sorting Visualizer" or "Searching Visualizer".
4.  On the visualizer page, you can:
    -   Generate a new array of random values.
    -   Select the algorithm you want to visualize.
    -   Control the speed of the visualization.
    -   Start the visualization and observe the algorithm in action.
